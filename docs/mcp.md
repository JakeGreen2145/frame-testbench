# Stdio MCP server

`frame-testbench-mcp` exposes the toolkit through the official Python MCP SDK's
FastMCP server. It uses stdin/stdout only. It opens no listening port and requires
no separate authentication service. The launching process and, for remote use,
your existing SSH configuration determine access.

## Install from a checkout

Requires Python 3.11 or newer. The ordinary CLI has no Python dependencies; MCP
is an optional extra. Use an isolated environment:

```sh
uv venv --python python3 .venv
uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python -e '.[mcp]'
make all
.venv/bin/frame-testbench-mcp --help
```

Without uv, use `python3 -m venv .venv` and
`.venv/bin/python -m pip install -e '.[mcp]'`. Some Debian installations need the
`python3-venv` OS package first. The MCP extra requires `mcp>=1.30,<2`.

An editable install preserves the CLI's checkout-relative `build/` path. Run
`make all` on the machine that actually runs the native observer. Remote-only
MCP clients do not need a local native build. The target checkout and its native
build must support the same CLI commands, including `controller`.

The Python wheel contains only `frame_testbench` and package metadata, not the
native binaries, build scripts, or OpenVR headers. A wheel alone is **not a
supported local native toolkit installation**. It can act as a remote SSH MCP
client. For local use, keep the checkout and editable installation above.

## Start and connect

Local SteamVR, under the same user/session as the toolkit:

```sh
/path/to/frame-testbench/.venv/bin/frame-testbench-mcp \
  --artifacts-dir /absolute/path/to/captures
```

Remote Steam Frame through an already configured SSH alias:

```sh
/path/to/frame-testbench/.venv/bin/frame-testbench-mcp \
  --host frame \
  --remote-root dev/frame-testbench \
  --artifacts-dir /absolute/path/to/captures
```

The remote root may be relative to the SSH user's home or absolute. SSH uses the
CLI's batch mode, host-key checking, and connection timeout. Configure keys and
known hosts yourself before starting the server. The server does not install,
uninstall, restart SteamVR, or change SSH configuration.

Generic MCP client configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "frame-testbench": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/frame-testbench/.venv/bin/frame-testbench-mcp",
      "args": [
        "--host", "frame",
        "--remote-root", "dev/frame-testbench",
        "--artifacts-dir", "/absolute/path/to/captures"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Omit `--host` and `--remote-root` for local use. For clients that provide a tool
call timeout, allow at least 450 seconds for capture and leave additional time
when queueing calls. The server's CLI subprocess timeout is 420 seconds, covering
the CLI's separately bounded status, capture, and fetch operations.

You can also launch `.venv/bin/python -m frame_testbench.mcp_server`, or use the
checkout launcher `.venv/bin/python /path/to/frame-testbench/frame-testbench-mcp`.
An editable install makes the module available regardless of working directory.

## Tools

| Tool | Arguments | CLI operation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `status` | None | `status` |
| `worn` | `state`: `on`, `off`, or `physical` | `worn STATE` |
| `hmd_pose_set` | Required `position`; optional `rotation`, `space` | `pose set` |
| `hmd_pose_move` | Optional `translation`, `rotation`, `space` | `pose move` |
| `hmd_pose_reset` | None | `pose reset` |
| `controller_pose_set` | Required `side`, `position`; optional `rotation`, `space` | `controller SIDE set` |
| `controller_pose_move` | Required `side`; optional `translation`, `rotation`, `space` | `controller SIDE move` |
| `controller_pose_reset` | Required `side` | `controller SIDE reset` |
| `compositor` | `mode`: `awake` or `auto` | `compositor MODE` |
| `capture` | None | `capture` with a server-owned output/fetch directory |
| `release_all` | None | `release` |

`side` is `left` or `right`. Position and translation are three-element XYZ
arrays in meters. Rotation is `[yaw, pitch, roll]` in degrees. All numbers must
be finite JSON numbers, not strings or booleans. Default translation and rotation
are `[0, 0, 0]`. Space is `standing` by default, or `raw`. Moves require a prior
pose set for that device and follow the existing CLI's coordinate conventions.

Examples of tool arguments:

```json
{"position": [0, 1.6, 0], "rotation": [30, 0, 0], "space": "standing"}
```

```json
{"side": "left", "translation": [0.1, 0, 0], "rotation": [0, 15, 0]}
```

Input overrides persist until explicitly reset or released. Disconnecting the
MCP client does not release them. `release_all` restores physical HMD/controller
tracking and proximity, but leaves the compositor policy unchanged. Use
`compositor` with `{"mode":"auto"}` separately to restore automatic standby.
Do not apply virtual tracking overrides while someone relies on normal tracking.

## Results and capture files

Successful tools return the actual CLI JSON as both a text content block and
`structuredContent`. Normal CLI failures and input validation errors return MCP
`isError: true`; they are not successful responses containing an error string.

`capture` also returns two `image/png` image blocks, in preview then stereo order,
with base64-encoded PNG bytes for vision-capable clients. The text and structured
metadata retain the CLI's runtime snapshots, image paths, and capture metadata.
The server does not substitute a path for image content or generate placeholder
screenshots.

Each capture gets a new private directory under `--artifacts-dir`, defaulting to
`artifacts` relative to the server working directory. Its `images/` child is left
absent for the CLI to create. Local captures use `--output`; SSH captures use
`--fetch` and read the downloaded `local_files`, never remote filesystem paths.
The server checks expected filenames, rejects symlinks and outside paths, checks
PNG signatures, and limits each returned image to 32 MiB. The native observer is
responsible for validating complete capture files. Oversized images fail instead
of being silently resized or omitted.

Captures, including partial failed captures, remain on disk for diagnosis. There
is no automatic retention policy. Delete old captures when no call is using
them, and treat screenshots as potentially sensitive.

## Execution boundaries

- Host, remote checkout, and artifact directory are fixed at startup. Tool calls
  cannot set a host, socket, output path, executable, or arbitrary command.
- Schemas reject unknown arguments, wrong types, unsupported enums, and nonfinite
  numbers before the CLI subprocess starts.
- Commands use literal argv, never a local shell. The existing CLI handles SSH
  quoting and backend validation.
- One server serializes all operations, including moves and captures. A cancelled
  MCP request holds the lock until its already-started backend operation finishes.
  Cancellation is not rollback. Separate servers or direct CLI calls are not
  coordinated by this lock; use one writer for a target.
- Stdout carries MCP JSON-RPC only. Diagnostics go to stderr. Backend stdout is
  captured and parsed as JSON, never forwarded directly to the client stream.
- Existing CLI environment overrides such as `FRAME_TESTBENCH_SOCKET` and
  `FRAME_TESTBENCH_OBSERVER` remain trusted launch-time configuration, not tool
  parameters. Give the server only the environment and SSH access it needs.

## Reproduce the tests

```sh
uv venv --python python3 .venv
uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python -e '.[mcp]'
make all
.venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_mcp*.py' -v
.venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

Without the extra, MCP-dependent tests skip; packaging metadata tests still run.
Do not count a skipped MCP suite as MCP verification. No hardware or SSH connection
is needed. Tests use an explicitly identified CPU-only observer fixture and a
real SDK client/server subprocess to exercise initialize, list-tools, tool calls,
backend errors, validation, PNG byte content, metadata, and stderr separation.
Unit tests also check CLI argv, fixed remote configuration, concurrency, and
cancellation. Existing native tests build and exercise their own CPU-only OpenVR
boundary. Live headset verification is a separate step.
